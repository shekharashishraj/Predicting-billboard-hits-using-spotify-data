PREDICTING BILLBOARD HOT 100 HITS USING SPOTIFY DATA
INTRODUCTION
The Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for songs,
published weekly by Billboard magazine. The Billboard HOT 100 is still one of the most reliable
ways to gauge a songâ€™s popularity. This project will be a walkthrough of simple machine learning
techniques applied to predict the songs that will become Billboard Hot 100 hits.
DATASET DESCRIPTION
Our dataset contains data from the following sources:
 http:/millionsongdataset.com/
https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100
Firstly, ten audio features will be extracted from the Spotify API. Spotify assigns each song a value
between 0 and 1 for these features except loudness which is measured in decibels.
AUDIO FEATURES
We will also create an artistic score metric, assigning a score of 1 if the artist previously had a
Billboard Hit, and 0 otherwise.
Algorithm Used
		

Logistic Regression used to predict a data value based on prior observation of a data set.
Supervised Learning: Splitting the data into 75/25 train test ratio.
Decision Tree to create a training model that can be used to predict the class or value of the target
variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the prior data(training data)
GDA for data classification
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems.
Neural Networks
Approach
1. Collect Raw data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis : It is an approach of analysing data sets to summarise their main
characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other visualisation methods. We will be
performing initial investigation on data to discover patterns, spot anomalies I.e, data cleaning
and test hypothesis with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.
3. Data Modelling: Split data in 75/25 proportion to test it
